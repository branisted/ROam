## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Local Adventure Planner allows users to explore local adventure ideas like hiking trails, escape rooms, cultural attractions, or food tours. Users can register as either **Adventurers** or **Organizers**, with separate views and functionality.

This application was developed as part of the FIS course project, with the following goals:
- Modern web development using **React** for frontend and **Node.js + SQLite** for backend.
- Secure user login and registration with different roles.
- Database persistence using SQLite.
- Clean architecture with modular components and routes.
- Interactive and responsive UI.
